# System
* We implement the project based on a Gateway workerman framework and some bootstrap snippets (UI). We are responsible for writing mainly for the backend logic (like `Application/Chat/Web/Events.php`) and front-end message display (like `Applications/Chat/Web/index.php`) for the functionalities related to encryption and messaging broadcasting. Some of the files are reserved and provided by the framework itself such as the `start_gateway.php, start_register.php and start_web.php`.
