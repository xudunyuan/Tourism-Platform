# Tourism-Platform

Developed a tourism website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, PHP for the back-end, and MySQL for the database. The website is for customers to plan their own trip according to their preference, and it could calculate the number of ‘weekly/monthly active’ people automatically.

Enable the administrator to update the information shown on the website and create/delete the customers.
